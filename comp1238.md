###Pre-Writing:

30,000 years ago: Cave paintings (e.g., rhinos in France).
20,000 years ago: Ishango bone with tally marks.
First Writing:

~5,000 years ago: Clay tablets in Mesopotamia (e.g., Uruk).
Cuneiform: Wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay.
Used for practical records like receipts (e.g., barley and beer).
Number Systems

###Babylonian Numerals:

System using two types of wedges, one means 10 the other means 1.
Numbers up to 59 are jsut sum of the two types wedges.
Then positional base-60 system similar to modern base-10.
Other Systems:

Egyptian: Symbols for powers of 10.
Roman: Subtractive notation (e.g., MCM = 1900).
Evolution of Writing

Sumerian Language: Used syllabic writing.
Epic of Gilgamesh: Early literature (~4,000 years ago).
Multilingual Inscriptions: Example of trilingual inscriptions (Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian) - Wikipedia

Woodblock Printing: Old wood-block print dated 868 AD in the text itself (Diamond Sutra).
Movable Type

Invention: Enabled rearranging characters for different texts.
Gutenberg Press: Revolutionized printing with metal movable type.
Gutenberg Bible: Luxury item, 180 copies produced.
Impact of Printing

Economic: Drastically reduced book prices.
Cultural: Facilitated Renaissance and Reformation.
Modern Writing Systems

###Alphabet Development

Phoenician Alphabet: Ancestor of many modern alphabets.
Independent Systems: Chinese, Mesoamerican, and others.
Typewriters and Keyboards

Purpose: Standardize text appearance, especially in business.
Monospace Fonts: Developed for typewriters, used in coding.
Key Terminology

Typeface: Design of letters.
Font: Collection of typefaces.
Serif/Sans Serif: Fonts with/without decorative strokes.
Uppercase/Lowercase: Originated from physical storage cases.


## Week 2

###Binary System

Bit: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).
Byte: Group of 8 bits.
Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2.
Memory Types

Volatile Memory: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).
Non-Volatile Memory: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).
Number Representation

Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.
Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.
Text Representation

ASCII Table: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').
Control Codes: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline).
File Types

Text Files: Interpreted as characters using ASCII.
Binary Files: Not intended to be read as text.
Historical Context

Morse Code: Early binary communication using short and long beeps.
Punch Cards: Early data storage method using holes to represent bits.
Teleprinters: Early devices for sending typed messages over long distances.
Additional Topics

###Number Systems

Decimal (Base 10): Standard human number system.
Binary (Base 2): Used in computing.
Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F.
Conversion Examples

Binary to Decimal: Sum powers of 2 for each '1' bit.
Hexadecimal to Decimal: Sum powers of 16 for each digit.
Memory and Storage

RAM: Fast, volatile memory for active processes.
Storage Devices: Include SSDs and HDDs, used for long-term data storage.
Practical Applications

Text Editors: Display bytes as characters using ASCII.
File Structure: Files are sequences of bytes, organized in directories.

###Study Tips

Understand the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.
Practice converting between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.
Familiarize yourself with ASCII and its role in text representation.
Explore how files are structured and the difference between text and binary files.


## Week 3

###Historical Context:
Early text structures in printing and typewriting.
Example: Ancient texts with commentary.
Modern Examples:
Newspapers, ledgers, and digital formats like JSON.

###Lines and Indentation:
Lines are fundamental in coding.
Indentation helps in visual understanding.
Paragraphs:
Important in HTML for text presentation.

###Markdown:

Simple syntax for formatting.
Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle
Italic: _italic_
Bold: **bold**
Lists: * item or - item
Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.
HTML:

###More verbose than Markdown.
Tags: <ul>, <li>, <p>, <strong>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>

###Special Characters:

Non-alphanumeric symbols like @, #, $, &, *.
Escape sequences prevent special interpretation.
Example: \# to display # in Markdown.
HTML Escaping:

Use &lt; for <, &gt; for >, &amp; for &.

###JSON:

Format: {"key": "value"}
Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.

###XML:

Similar to HTML, used for data representation.
Tags: <tag>value</tag>

###GitHub:
Platform for version control and collaboration.
Markdown is used for documentation (README.md).
Create accounts with personal emails for longevity.

Similar to ASCII - assigns numbers to characters, but allows for much larger numbers and therefore more characters.
While in ASCII the numbers are called "ASCII codes", in unicode the name used is "Unicode codepoints"
In contrast to ASCII there are multiple different ways of converting the codepoints into a binary representation:
UTF-32 simply uses 4 bytes to store the codepoint number of in binary, but this wastes a lot of space because most bytes end up being filled with zeroes.
UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for all the basic characters but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. UTF-8 is by far the most popular encoding on the internet.
Unicode codepoints are usually written as hex number with prefix U+ for example U+21AA is the codepoint for this character: â†ª
Note that the binary representation for this codepoint will be different depending on which encoding is used, but in most cases we use UTF-8.Browsers:

Complex software handling HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Different rendering engines: Blink (Chrome, Edge), WebKit (Safari).
Lab Exercise:

###Practice editing Markdown on GitHub.
Submit screenshots of rendered Markdown.
